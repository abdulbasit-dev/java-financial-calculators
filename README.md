# Mortgage Calculator

## Overview

This Java program is a simple Mortgage Calculator that allows users to calculate their mortgage payments based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and loan period (in years).

<br>
**Note:** This Java program is implemented using procedural programming. If you're interested in the object-oriented programming (OOP) version, check out the `mortgage-calculator` branch.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone -b mortgage-calculator-procedural  https://github.com/abdulbasit-dev/java-financial-calculators.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd java-financial-calculators/src
```

3. Compile and run the program.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the required information:

   - Principal amount ($1k - $1M)
   - Annual interest rate (1% - 30%)
   - Loan period in years (1 - 30)

5. The program will then calculate and display the monthly mortgage payment.
